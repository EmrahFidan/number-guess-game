<h1 style="color: #219ebc;"> 💯 Number Guess Game </h1>

This project is a number prediction game that I made for my lesson and use the C language.

<h2 style="color: #0081a7;"> Game Rules</h2>

- Assume that the user enters four as digit number. 
- And four digit random number generated by the program is “8203”. The user will try to guess the number. The
following figures are sample prediction cases.
- If the guess is correct a “congratulations”
message will be printed.
All 4 digits are correct and in their correct
location so the result will be “+4”.
Record the number of guesses. And print the
prediction number as “Total number of
tries=…"
- If the guess is “2830”, each of the four numbers
exist in “8203” but none of them are located in
correct place.
So 4 numbers are guessed and each in wrong
location.
The result will be +0-4.
- If the guess is “8572”, 8 and 2 exist in “8203”.
“2” is in wrong place and “8” is located in
correct place. So two of the numbers are guessed
one of them is in correct place and one of them
is not.
The result will be +1-1.
- If the guess is “8291”, 8 and 2 exist in “8203”.
Both located in correct place. So two of the
numbers are guessed in correct place.
The result will be +2-0.
- If the guess is “9765”, none of the numbers exist
in “8203”.
So the result must be +0-0.
- The digit number will be taken from user and one can play the game for 4 digit, 5 digit,...9 digit
numbers.




<h2 style="color: #0081a7;"> Lessons Learned </h2>

I learned to make a simple game with the C language. I noticed all the details of the modu acquisition functionality and started to explore data structures by developing myself in terms of array use with this project.
